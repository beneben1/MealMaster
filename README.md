## Introduction

The MealMaster App is a mobile application designed to help users plan their diets based on their health goals and preferences. The app allows users to answer a set of questions to determine their goal (weight loss, staying healthy, or muscle building) and then calculates the recommended daily calorie intake. Users can choose from three basic diets: normal, fasting (intermittent fasting), and vegan. The app provides detailed information about each diet and allows users to create an account to save their diet plans and track their progress over time.

## Features

- Goal selection (weight loss, stay healthy, muscle building mass)
- User profile creation and login functionality
- Daily calorie recommendation calculation
- Diet selection (normal, fasting, vegan) with detailed explanations
